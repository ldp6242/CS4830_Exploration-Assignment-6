Ruby On Rails Ecommerce App
This week I decided to do my exploration assignment on ruby on rails. I decided to build a ecommerce app using the rails framework. I first tackled this project by learning the basic syntax of ruby first. Then after a couple of exercises I was able to start developing an web app. 

Ruby is a pretty simple language to learn upfront. I like the overall simplicity of it, which makes it pretty fun to program in.

I have developed this web app through codecademy which hosted all the ruby on rail files. I am currenlty 30% done with this course and as proof on concept I have attached an image in this repository. The framework of ruby on rails is taking a little time to get use to but I am very interested in learning more.
