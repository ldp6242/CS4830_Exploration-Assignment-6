Ruby On Rails Ecommerce App
This week I decided to do my exploration assignment on ruby on rails. I decided to build a ecommerce app using the rails framework. I first tackled this project by learning the basic syntax of ruby first. Then after a couple of exercises I was able to develop an web app. 

Ruby is a pretty simple language to learn upfront. I like the overall simplicity of it, which makes it pretty fun to program in.
